I'm a student developer driven by a curiosity for AI and machine learning. Whether I'm leading the FlintAI club (a subset of the Technology club), competing in Science Olympiad, or coding, I love digging into complex problems. I also stay active in the debate community as a competitor, coach, and judge, which has helped me learn to communicate technical ideas to anyone. I wish to continue learning about AI in college to explore how we can use logic and tech to solve real-world problems.
